#Colorful Notes App
Welcome to the Colorful Notes App! This simple application allows users to create and manage colorful notes. Each note's color is determined by the tag under which it is created, and users have the flexibility to choose colors for their tags. The notes contain a title, text, creation date and time, and the tag name under which they were created. Additionally, each note has a delete button for easy removal.
